								I am a Ph.D candidate at the University of Pittsburgh studying massive post-starburst galaxies as a part of the <a href="http://squigglesurvey.github.io" target="_blank">SQuIGGLE</a> (Studying Quenching in Intermediate-Redshift Galaxies: Gas, anguLar momentum, and Evolution) Survey under the supervision of Dr. Rachel Bezanson. My research is focused on studying the spatially resolved stellar populations of galaxies which have recently shut off their primary epoch of star formation. When I'm not reducing Gemini data or fitting Sersic profiles, I am usually attending concerts, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBJeNS1URPk&ab_channel=DavidSetton" target="_blank">playing guitar for my band</a>, or watching the Seahawks at a Pittsburgh dive bar.

								<b>Extended Post-Starburst Signatures in Massive z~0.6 Galaxies</b>
								<br>Using GMOS IFU observations of galaxies in the SQuIGGLE survey, we observe extended H-delta absorption in our sample of massive galaxies at intermediate-redshift, indicating that the galaxies shut off their star formation simultaneously at all radii.

								<b>The Compact Structures of z~0.7 Post-Starburst Galaxies</b>
								<br>Using deep Hyper-Sumprime Cam imaging, we characterize the mass-size relation for z~0.7 post-starburst galaxies and find that they are more compact than co-eval star-forming and quiescent galaxies.

								<b>The Growth of the Quiescent Sequence</b>
								<br>Using early spectroscopy from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Survey, I have quantified the growth of the red sequence due to rapid quenching by measuring the number density of post-starburst galaxies out to z~1.3.
