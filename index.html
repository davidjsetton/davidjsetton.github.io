								<b>Post-starburst galaxies in the wake of cosmic noon: what drives rapid quenching?</b>
								<br>As a part of the SQuIGGLE Survey, I am working to conduct population level-studiies of post-starburst galaxies selected from the SDSS and DESI spectrosopic samples. Using novel SED fitting techniques, we have quantified the star formation histories of these samples, and have studied their structures and gas contents as they relate to their recent star formation. Lately, I have been working on a large CO(2-1) study of these systems using data obtained in my ALMA programs to understand why SQuIGGLE post-starbursts exhibit a diversity in CO-luminosity. I am also excited about my upcoming ALMA/JWST joint program that will obtain high resolution CO(2-1) and Pa-Alpha maps of the most CO-luminous galaxies in our sample.

								<b>Understanding the mysterious "V-shaped" SED of Little Red Dots</b>
								<br>As a part of the RUBIES and UNCOVER surveys, I am working to understand what is producing the continuum shape and line emission in Little Red Dots. Using the full sample of PRISM spectra in the Dawn JWST Archive, I selected all extremely red Halpha emitters and found that the turnover in the LRD spectra ubiquitously occurs at 3645 A, the wavelength associated with n=2 Balmer absorption/emission. I also used deep JWST/MIRI and ALMA imaging to place the deepest constraints on the LRD IR luminosity to date, showing that models that invoke significant reddening of an intrinsically blue SED are in tension with the lack of detections of dust continuum at any temperature.

								<b>The star formation histories and structures of the first massive, passive galaxies with JWST</b>
								<br>Also with RUBIES and UNCOVER, I am working to study the star formation histories of the first galaxies in the universe that exhibit strong Balmer breaks. We have discovered extremely intersting systems at early cosmic times that in many ways defy predictions, including a logM~11 quenched galaxy at z=5, a passive logM~10.3 galaxy at z=7, and a massive dusty galaxy with very low equivalent width Halpha and a star foramtion history that implies very early formation at z~4. I am also working with students at Princeton and Pitt to study the spatially resolved structures, star formation histories, and rates of AGN incidence in large samples of systems at and above z=2.
