								I am a Brinson Prize Fellow at the Princeton University Department of Astrophysical Sciences studying massive galaxies as a part of the <a href="http://squigglesurvey.github.io" target="_blank">SQuIGGLE</a>, <a href="https://www.desi.lbl.gov/" target="_blank">DESI</a>, and <a href="https://jwst-uncover.github.io/" target="_blank">UNCOVER</a> surveys. My research focuses on understanding the physical mechanism that drives the shutdown of star formation in massive galaxies by placing constraints on the star formation histories, structures, and number densities of recently quenched systems. I am also very interested in Little Red Dots and understanding their strange "V"-shaped spectral energy distributon.

								<b>Post-starburst galaxies in the wake of cosmic noon: what drives rapid quenching</b>
								<br>As a part of the SQuIGGLE Survey, I am working to conduct population level-studiies of post-starburst galaxies selected from the SDSS and DESI spectrosopic samples. Using novel SED fitting techniques, we have quantified the star formation histories of these samples, and have studied their structures and gas contents as they relate to their recent star formation. Lately, I have been working on a large CO(2-1) study of these systems using data obtained in my ALMA programs to understand why SQuIGGLE post-starbursts exhibit a diversity in CO-luminosity. I am also excited about my upcoming ALMA/JWST joint program that will obtain high resolution CO(2-1) and Pa-Alpha maps of the most CO-luminous galaxies in our sample.

								<b>The Growth of the Quiescent Sequence with DESI Spectroscopy</b>
								<br>Using early spectroscopy from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Survey, I have quantified the growth of the red sequence due to rapid quenching by identifying post-starburst galaxies using their star formation histories. I have measured the number density of post-starburst galaxies out to z~1.3 as a function of their recent burst fraction and identified the largest sample of spectroscopically confirmed post-starburst galaxies at z>1.
